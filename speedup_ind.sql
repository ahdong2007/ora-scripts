REM set sort_area_size to 700M or 1.6 * table_size
REM 10g bug need to set sort_area_size twice
REM remember large sort area size doesn't mean better performance
REM sometimes you should reduce below setting,and then sort may benefit from disk sort
REM and attention to avoid PGA swap

REM set sort area first,and then set SMRC for parallel slave
REM Setting this parameter can activate our previous setting of sort_area_size
REM and we can have large sort multiblock read counts.

rem !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!IMPORTANT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
rem If the performance of a query has degraded and the majority of the
rem time is spent in the function kghfrempty, and the function that called
rem kghfrempty was kxsfwa called from kksumc, then you may be encountering
rem this problem.
rem Workaround:
rem Reducing sort_area_size may help by reducing the amount of memory that
rem each sort allocates, particularly if the IO subsystem is underutilized.
rem The performance of some queries that involved large sorts degraded due
rem to the memory allocation pattern used by sort.
